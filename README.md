# Learning-Speech-from-Accelerometer-Measurements

We recognize and reconstruct speech information/signal from accelerometer in this project. 
The accelerometer measurements are preprocessed by Matlab code into acceleration spectrograms, and then, the accerelation spectrograms are input into DenseNet/StyleTransfer for recognization and reconstruction.
The reconstructed speech spectrograms will be processed by GL algorithm to reconstruct the speech signal.

The preprocessing code is in "preprocess" directory

The recognization code is in "recognization" directory

The reconstruction code is in "reconstruction" directory

The GL code is in "GL" directory

We are still working on polishing some code, pls stay tuned.

If there is any question/problem, pls contact tzheng4@buffalo.edu
